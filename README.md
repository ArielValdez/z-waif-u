## Current To-Do

- Make the RAG/Long Term Memory be multiprocessed for better performance
- Fix repetition issues at the end of speech to text Whisper by manually removing
- Look more into optimal LLMs and configs
- Re-Add support for multimodal A.K.A. support for sending images
- Fix issues where leaving the bot on for a while can cause a bit more lag between messages
