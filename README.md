# z-waif
Fully local &amp; open source AI Waifu. VTube Studio, Discord, Minecraft, custom made RAG (long term memory), alarm, and plenty more! Has a WebUI and hotkey shortcuts. All software is free (or extremely cheap)!

Requires Windows 10/11 and a CUDA (NVidia) GPU with atleast 12GB+ of video memory. 16GB is recommended.
Uses Oobabooga, RVC, and Whisper to run all AI systems locally. Works as a front end to tie many programs together into one cohesive whole.

The goal of the project is less about giving an "all in one package", and moreso to give you the tools and knowledge for you to create your own AI Waifu!

## Recent Changelog

v1.5-R2

- While using streaming text, emotes are now threaded, meaning that there is no pause for them to happen.
- The VtubeStudio interactions now use a try-catch system, adding general resistance to errors.
- Added in more implementation for Unipipes - the system that basically will manage the centralized execution of code.

- Enhanced the ".bat" files, making them pause after a crash happens.

- Fixed an error where the random looking would cause a crash due to requests not closing properly.
- Fixed an issue with the Discord module crashing when emotes would be triggered.

---.---.---.---

- Stopping Strings (what cuts off your waifu if they try talking out of format) can now be changed in the configurables.
- There is now a "Send" button you can click next to the textbox.
- The primary color of the interface is now changeable via the configurables. This changes the color of the borders, checkboxes, and the new "Send" button.

## State of Development

The project could be considered in an "early access state". Some parts may be mildly buggy, janky, or obtuse. The project as a whole, however, is stable and reasonably effective.

The goal of the project is pretty simple; make AI partners that are not owned by not any corporation or government, but the people whoms't they are partnered with. The extents of this project are intended to stay within the bounds of giving a singular, locally hosted AI waifu, primarily for partnered use. The eventual end-game goal is to create partners for people who can have a robot body to interact with the world, and who can experience and learn things on their own terms; however lofty and unfeasible that goal may be. In short, symbiosis.
