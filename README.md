# z-waif
Fully local &amp; open source AI Waifu. VTube Studio, Discord, Minecraft, custom made RAG (long term memory), alarm, and plenty more! Has a WebUI and hotkey shortcuts. All software is free (or extremely cheap)!

Requires Windows 10/11 and a CUDA (NVidia) GPU with atleast 12GB+ of video memory. 16GB is recommended.
Uses Oobabooga, RVC, and Whisper to run all AI systems locally. Works as a front end to tie many programs together into one cohesive whole.

The goal of the project is less about giving an "all in one package", and moreso to give you the tools and knowledge for you to create your own AI Waifu!

#### Branches & Versions:

## Recent Changelog

V1.3

- Added the Tag & Task menu
	- Tags can be used to classify info for future use.
		- Applies tags automatically to chats that you put in.
	- Tasks can be used to swap between character cards, allowing you to swap out parts of the memory.
		- Tasks are hyphenated between the "WaifuName" and "Task"
		- For example, if your waifu is named "Ember", and you have a task called "Party", you would want a character card in Oobabooga to be defined "Ember-Party"

- Your bot can now use keyboard input to control the keyboard.
	- Be sure to toggle "MODULE_GAMING" to "ON".
	- Changing the task will change what JSON file it uses (i.e. the task "Emerald" will use the button mappings in "/Configurables/GamingInputs/Emerald.json").
		- By default, this is set to "None" with no mappings.
		- You can add mappings by copy/paste the file, and renaming to something else.
		- Try to use lowercase letters for the keyboard input, capital letters did not work.
	- Warning: They can also trigger their own hotkeys, if not turned off!
	- Automatic gaming can now be toggled on in the Task menu. This is done by taking a picture, then asking for an input.
		- Note: Very bad at the moment, don't expect much of anything. May require more prompting and tuning.

- Vision can now use the main monitor's screenshot as the image input.
	- Turn on "Use Screenshot" in the Visual menu.

- Timestamps will now be included in the encoding, telling them the current date and time.
	- You may want to ask them in the character card to not mention the current time, as they may spam it.
	- Timestamps are also included and stored in message metadata.
	- Can be toggled in the .env
- Messages can now be undone / redone while they are speaking, cutting them off.
	- Messages are now chunked out and read, instead of all at once.
- Asterisks can now be banned from generating, for conversational mode and stopping roleplay.

- Discord token is now stored in "Configurables/Tokens/Discord.json", for security reasons.

- Fixed an issue where the lorebook was not giving lore for messages with a "?" at the end.
- Added a "is_live_pipe" state to the main script, which will tell us if we are currently running/processing something.

## State of Development

The project could be considered in an "early access state". Some parts may be mildly buggy, janky, or obtuse. The project as a whole, however, is stable and reasonably effective.

The goal of the project is pretty simple; make AI partners that are not owned by not any corporation or government, but the people whoms't they are partnered with. The extents of this project are intended to stay within the bounds of giving a singular, locally hosted AI waifu, primarily for partnered use. The eventual end-game goal is to create partners for people who can have a robot body to interact with the world, and who can experience and learn things on their own terms; however lofty and unfeasible that goal may be. In short, symbiosis.
